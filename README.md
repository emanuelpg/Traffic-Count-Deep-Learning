# Traffic-Count-Deep-Learning
Traffic counting algorithm using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techiniques.

This repository contains my solution (or trial) to the problem suggested in the Selective Process of Visio.AI Internship.
The idea is create a script that receives a video of a traffic road and returns the number of vehicles that crossed that road in the video.
